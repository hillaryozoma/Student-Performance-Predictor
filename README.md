# INTRODUCTION
This project leverages data analytics to enhance student outcomes at **Encomium International College**, a culturally diverse institution. By examining how factors like parental education, extracurricular involvement, and study habits influence academic success, the initiative aims to identify key performance drivers through exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling. By uncovering patterns and relationships within demographic, academic, and extracurricular data, the project intends to provide timely and targeted interventions, ensuring equitable support for all students and promoting a data-driven approach to achieving educational excellence.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
**Encomium International College** is tackling the challenge of deciphering the various factors that affect student performance, encompassing demographic, academic, and extracurricular elements. The institution aims to pinpoint the most influential predictors of academic success, identify patterns and correlations among these variables, and create a predictive model to categorize students by grade levels. This initiative seeks to facilitate timely, targeted interventions and provide equitable support, catering to the diverse needs of students and improving overall educational outcomes.

# AIM OF THE PROJECT
Identify academic and non-academic factors that are most predictive of student success.
Uncover patterns, trends, and relationships among demographic, academic, and extracurricular variables.
Develop a predictive model to classify students into grade categories for timely and targeted interventions.
Provide actionable insights to support diverse student needs effectively and equitably.
Foster a data-driven approach to improving academic outcomes and student support strategies.

# METHODOLOGY
**Data Cleaning**: Handle any missing values. Check for and correct anomalies.
**Data Exploration**: Conduct basic statistical analysis to understand the distribution of each variable. Also Identify outliers, patterns, and trends in the data.
**Univariate Analysis**: Examine the distribution and spread of key variables, such as study time, parental education level, and GPA. Also Explore how frequently students participate in activities like sports, music, and volunteering.
**Bivariate Analysis**: Analyze relationships between pairs of variables, for instance, the correlation between GPA and study time or absences. Investigate gender or ethnicity differences in academic performance.
**Multivariate Analysis**: Examine interactions between multiple factors to identify complex relationships, such as how extracurricular activities and parental support jointly affect student performance.
**Data Visualization**: Utilize a variety of visualizations to effectively communicate findings and trends

# LIBRARIES
**NumPy**: It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
**Pandas**: It offers data structures (like DataFrames) for handling and analyzing structured data, particularly for data manipulation and cleaning.
**Matplotlib.pyplot**: A plotting library used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
**Seaborn**: Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn simplifies the creation of informative and attractive statistical graphics.

# EXPECTED OUTCOME
**Improved Understanding**: Deeper insights into factors affecting student performance.
**Proactive Interventions**: Data-driven strategies to support underperforming students.
**Enhanced Equity**: Tailored solutions to address diverse student needs, ensuring fair academic support for all.
